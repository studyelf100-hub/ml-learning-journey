# 💡 My Project Ideas

*This file is my brainstorming space for ML, deep learning, and hybrid projects. I’ll keep adding ideas as I learn and experiment.*

## 📊 Classical ML Projects

1. **Spam Detector**

   * Classify emails as spam or not spam
   * Use logistic regression and decision trees
   * Practice text preprocessing and feature engineering

2. **Sentiment Analysis**

   * Predict sentiment (positive/negative) from tweets or reviews
   * Experiment with different feature vectors
   * Use Python and scikit-learn

3. **House Price Prediction**

   * Regression model using Kaggle dataset
   * Explore feature selection, scaling, and model evaluation

4. **Customer Segmentation**

   * Cluster customers based on purchase behavior
   * Apply K-means and PCA
   * Visualize clusters

## 🧠 Deep Learning Projects

1. **Digit Recognition (MNIST)**

   * CNN to classify handwritten digits
   * Experiment with different architectures

2. **Image Classifier on Fashion-MNIST or CIFAR-10**

   * Practice data augmentation
   * Compare CNN vs ResNet performance

3. **Text Generation with LSTM**

   * Generate short text sequences
   * Explore sequence-to-sequence learning

4. **Transformer Fine-Tuning**

   * Text classification with BERT or DistilBERT
   * Fine-tune on a small dataset for practice

## 🌐 Web + ML Hybrid Projects

1. **Mini Web Dashboard for ML Models**

   * Display model predictions interactively
   * Use Flask or FastAPI for backend

2. **SAT Helper Tool**

   * Web app that generates practice questions
   * Track performance and suggest next steps

3. **Flashcard Generator**

   * ML-based tool for vocabulary or math practice
   * Can incorporate spaced repetition logic

## 🔬 Research / Experimental Projects

1. **Paper Reproduction**

   * Pick one AI/ML research paper per year
   * Reproduce results and document experiments

2. **Custom Dataset Experiments**

   * Collect small datasets
   * Apply supervised or unsupervised learning
   * Try novel preprocessing techniques

3. **RL Mini Projects**

   * Simple reinforcement learning agent for games
   * Track rewards and visualize learning curves

## 📝 Notes

* I will mark each project as **“To Do” → “In Progress” → “Completed”**
* I will link projects to my `roadmap.md` and `notes.md` as I work on them
* All experiments will be logged in GitHub with proper README and comments
