## 🐾 Year 0 – Foundations (Age 15–16)

*Goal: Build strong math and programming foundations and get confident with Git/GitHub.*

### Math

* I will review pre-algebra → algebra → functions
* I will work on geometry and basic trigonometry
* I will start learning basic statistics

### Coding

* I will strengthen my Python skills (loops, functions, classes, error handling)
* I will learn NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn
* I will practice using Jupyter notebooks

### Tools & Workflow

* I will learn Git and GitHub properly
* I will create this ML learning repo and keep it updated
* I will practice VS Code, virtual environments, and project organization

### Mini-Projects

* I will analyze temperature datasets
* I will implement linear regression from scratch
* I will create a Titanic ML model
* I will build simple visualizations

**Outcome:** I will have confidence with math, Python, and my workflow. My GitHub will start to look alive.

## 🐾 Year 1 – Core ML & Projects (Age 16–17)

*Goal: Fully understand classical ML and produce portfolio-ready projects.*

### Core ML Theory

* I will learn supervised vs unsupervised learning
* I will practice train/test splits and evaluation metrics
* I will understand overfitting and underfitting
* I will implement cross-validation

### Algorithms

* I will learn and practice:

  * Linear & Logistic Regression
  * Decision Trees & Random Forests
  * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  * Naive Bayes
  * SVM
  * PCA

### Projects

* I will build a spam detector
* I will do sentiment classification
* I will predict house prices
* I will create a basic image classifier

### Math Expansion

* I will study linear algebra for ML
* I will learn calculus basics (derivatives, gradients)
* I will review probability theory

**Outcome:** I will have a full classical ML portfolio and be ready for remote internships.

## 🐾 Year 2 – Deep Learning Specialization (Age 17–18)

*Goal: Transition from classical ML to deep learning and build complex projects.*

### Deep Learning Fundamentals

* I will study perceptrons and feedforward networks
* I will learn loss functions and optimizers (SGD, Adam)
* I will practice backpropagation

### Advanced Architectures

* I will learn CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs
* I will explore attention mechanisms and transformer basics

### Tools

* I will use PyTorch for all projects
* I will optionally learn CUDA for GPU acceleration
* I will log experiments using WandB or local tracking

### Projects

* I will train a CNN with data augmentation
* I will classify images from an open dataset
* I will build an LSTM for text prediction
* I will fine-tune a transformer model for text classification

**Outcome:** I will be confident in deep learning and ready to implement research-level projects.

## 🐾 Year 3 – Research Engineering Prep (Age 18–19)

*Goal: Become employable as a Research Engineer and build a portfolio for remote work.*

### Specialization Track

* I will choose one focus: NLP, Computer Vision, RL, Multimodal AI, AI Safety, or MLOps
* I will dive deep into that area and build research-level projects

### Research Skills

* I will read and reproduce papers
* I will train models with PyTorch Lightning
* I will design experiment pipelines and log results
* I will focus on reproducibility and clean code

### Final Projects

* I will train a transformer on a custom dataset
* I will fine-tune BERT/LLAMA-like models
* I will build a multimodal classifier
* I will document all experiments in my GitHub repo

**Outcome:** I will be ready for remote AI research internships or junior research engineer roles.
